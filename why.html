    UNs sustainable development goal number 12 is "Ensure
    sustainable consumption and production patterns". 
A big part of this solution is cutting down on foodwaste.
<br><br>
Every year an estimated 33% procent of all food ends up going to waste. 
The worth of all this food is estimatemated to 1 trillion USD. 
In other words, making sure you eat up all the food you buy is not only good for the planet, it's also good for your wallet.

      and meal planning, excess buying (influenced
      by over-large portioning and package sizes),
      confusion over labels (best before and use by)
      and poor in-home storing.<br>
